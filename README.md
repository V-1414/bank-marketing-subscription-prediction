# bank-marketing-subscription-prediction
Predicting customer subscription to fixed deposits using classification models on marketing campaign data.

This project involves predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a fixed deposit following a phone-based marketing campaign. We used classification models (Logistic Regression, CART, KNN, Neural Networks) to analyse the bank marketing dataset.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- **Demographic info**: Age, job, marital status, education level
- **Campaign info**: Previous campaign outcomes, number of contacts
- **Financial details**: Credit score, balance, loans

Target Variable: `y` (Subscription: yes/no)

## ðŸ§  Models & Accuracy
| Model            | Accuracy |
|------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | **90%** |
| CART             | 89.6%    |
| Neural Network   | 89.1%    |
| KNN              | 89.0%    |
| Naive Bayes      | 82.6%    |

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `Hackathon.ipynb`: Main code and analysis
